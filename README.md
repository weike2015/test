# Game Description
  This simple game is inspired by Temple Run and Minion Rush, which are two popular endless running video games. In the game, the player is represented by the "woodman" in the center, who is always running forward. The goal of the player is to use keyboard to control the man to move left or right to dodge the obstacles(stones) and collect as many coins as possible. Once the woodman hit the stones, he will die, and the game is over. The score is kept on the upper right corner of the screen, the longer the player stays alive, and the more coin the player collects, the higher his score will get.


#  Keyboard control and interaction
  1. Up arrow key: user press up arrow key to start the game
  2. Left and right arrow key: move the woodman to the left or to the right
  3. Enter: after the woodman dies, user press Enter to start over
  4. A,D: These two keys allow user to rotate the camera to see the setting of the game (god mod)
